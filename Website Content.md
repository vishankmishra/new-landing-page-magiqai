You're Working Harder Than Ever—But the 
Numbers Aren't Moving 
Subheadline: 

Sound familiar? You're not alone. This is what every VP of Sales tells us. 

4-Column Pain Points: 

💸 Budget Burning, Revenue Stalling 



Monthly spend: $8K-$10K on tools and leads 
 Conversion rate: Only 2% 

You're hemorrhaging budget on prospects who were never going to buy.

 70% of time on non-selling activities 

Your closers should be selling, not searching LinkedIn for 4 hours a day. 



🎯 Chasing the Wrong Deals 

50-60% of your team misses quota 
 Not because they can't sell—but because they're burning time on bad-fit prospects. 



📊 Drowning in Data, Starving for Answers 

You have Apollo, ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Nav, your CRM... 

But you still can't answer: "Which deals should we prioritize TODAY?"

There's a better way. And it's powered by AI.
