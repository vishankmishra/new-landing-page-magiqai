      //   question:
      //     "How is MagiQ AI different from Apollo, ZoomInfo, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator?",
      //   answer:
      //     "Those are contact databases. They help you find emails and phone numbers. MagiQ AI is an intelligence platform. We tell you which contacts to prioritize and exactly how to win the deal.\n\nWe predict win probability, generate complete sales strategies, write personalized outreach, and provide an AI coach. These are capabilities you won't find in data platforms.\n\nThink of us as the AI decision layer that sits on top of your existing tools and makes them 10X more effective.",

      // {
      //   question: "What geographies do you cover?",
      //   answer:
      //     "We have deep, reliable coverage across:\n• India (all major cities + tier-2 markets)\n• Singapore\n• Malaysia\n• UAE\n• United States\n\nExpanding in 2025: Australia (Q3), United Kingdom (Q3)\n\nUnlike platforms built for Western markets that export poor-quality data elsewhere, we provide consistent intelligence depth across all our covered regions.",

      // {
      //   question: "Do I need to replace my existing sales tools?",
      //   answer:
      //     "No. MagiQ AI integrates seamlessly with your current stack:\n\n✅ CRMs: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Microsoft Dynamics\n✅ Email: Gmail, Outlook, Office 365\n✅ Sales Engagement: Outreach, SalesLoft, Apollo\n✅ Other: LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Slack, Zapier, Make\n\nWe enhance your workflow. We don't replace it. Most customers keep their existing tools and use MagiQ AI as the intelligence layer on top.",

      //   question: "Can I try before I buy?",
