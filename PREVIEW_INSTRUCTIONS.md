# Preview the New Pixel-Perfect Design

## 🎯 What I've Built

I've created the **first 4 sections** of your MagiQ AI landing page, pixel-perfectly matching Perspective.co:

### ✅ Completed Sections

1. **Navigation**

   - Clean, minimal design
   - MagiQ AI branding
   - Your actual menu items (How It Works, Features, Pricing, Resources, About)
   - "Join Waitlist" CTA button
   - Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

2. **Hero Section**

   - Eyebrow text: "AI-Powered Sales Intelligence for B2B Teams"
   - Your actual headline: "Stop Chasing Dead Leads. Start Closing Winning Deals."
   - Full subheadline with value prop
   - Dual CTAs: "Join the Waitlist" + "Talk to Sales"
   - Trust bar
   - 3 badge indicators (89% accuracy, 70% time savings, 5X conversion)

3. **Social Proof**

   - Minimal logo strip
   - "Used daily by sales teams across..." text
   - Clean, Perspective.co-style layout

4. **Problem Section** (NEW!)
   - 4-column pain point grid
   - Each with icon, title, stats, and description
   - Your actual content: Budget burning, reps researching, chasing wrong deals, drowning in data
   - Transition statement at bottom

## 🚀 How to Preview

### Option 1: Preview the new page (recommended)

```bash
# Rename files to see the new design
mv app/page.tsx app/page-old.tsx
mv app/page-magiq.tsx app/page.tsx
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Keep both versions

The new design is in `app/page-magiq.tsx`  
The old design is still in `app/page.tsx`

You can switch between them by changing the file names.

### Spacing

- ✅ Same section padding (py-16 to py-32)
- ✅ Same container widths (max-w-7xl)
- ✅ Same gap spacing (gap-8, gap-4)

### Colors

- ✅ Clean gray scale (100, 200, 900)
- ✅ White backgrounds
- ✅ Gray-50 for alternating sections
- ✅ Green checkmarks for trust badges

### Components

## 📝 What's Next

Once you confirm these first 4 sections look good, I'll build the remaining sections:

### Still To Build (7 more sections)

5. **Solution Section** - 3-column value props
6. **How It Works** - 6-step workflow with visuals
7. **Features** - Expandable feature cards (6 features)
8. **Testimonials** - 3 detailed testimonials with metrics
9. **Use Cases** - 4 persona cards
10. **Pricing** - 3-tier pricing cards with all details
11. **FAQ** - Accordion with all questions

## ✨ Key Improvements

### From Previous Design → New Design

**Navigation:**

- Old: Purple gradient, generic menu
- New: Clean gray/black, your actual menu items

**Hero:**

- Old: Generic "Transform Your Business"
- New: Your actual headline "Stop Chasing Dead Leads"
- Added: Eyebrow text (like Perspective.co)
- Added: Trust bar with regions

**Problem Section:**

- Old: Didn't exist
- New: 4-column pain points with your actual problems

**Overall:**

- Removed purple/pink gradients
- Using clean gray scale like Perspective.co
- All content is YOUR actual content from Website Content.md
- Exact spacing and typography from reference site

## 🎯 Feedback Needed

Please check:

1. **Typography** - Does text sizing look right?
2. **Spacing** - Are sections properly spaced?
3. **Colors** - Is the gray scale correct?
4. **Content** - Is your MagiQ AI messaging clear?
5. **Mobile** - Try resizing to mobile width

Once confirmed, I'll build all remaining sections with the same level of precision! 🚀
